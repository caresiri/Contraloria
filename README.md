Guía Ciudadana
================

## Motivación 

This exercise was designed as part of an ongoing collaboration between
INCAE Business School and Contraloría General de la República de Costa
Rica. It presents to the student with a concrete data challenge: As a
result of an open government policy, the Costa Rican Republic has made
its procurement data publicly available. The student is presented with
some context information, a brief introduction to a basic framework on
public value creation, a set of questions to help as a guide to
understand the underlying technical infrastructure allowing this
ability, and finally with a subset of data (over a hundred lines) of
public data. The dataset contains five years of information on
information technology that was acquired or rented using public funds.
The challenge is to propose to public officials concrete ways to add
value based on their analysis of these data.

## Objectives

  - Test and develop the basic skills for data management and
    exploratory data analysis
  - Recognize the benefits and drawbacks of being a power user as
    opposed to information consumers from predefined searches in a
    Business Intelligence platform
  - Recognize the challenges for Open Government Initiatives in terms of
    design, implementation and adoption
